AdBlockDetector
===============

AdBlock detector: a script to detect, collect stats in Google Analytics and eventually show a message or deny content to the user who got AdBlock enabled 

NOTICE: FOR NOW IT WORKS ONLY WITH THE ADSENSE NEW CODE, the one with the ```<ins>``` html5 tag

____
 
  Experimental script to detect AdBlock
  
  REQUIREMENTS: jQuery loaded before of this javascript file
  
  PAY ATTENTION: THERE IS A LITTLE CHANCE OF FALSE POSITIVES,
  ALSO PLEASE DON'T USE MESSAGES THAT INVITE YOUR USERS TO CLICK ON ADs
  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK
 
  I advice to use it just to collect stats to GA (default configuration does this only)
  as it will log events google analytics and it's useful to
  gather info about the % of your traffic that uses AdBlock
  
  NOTICE: FOR NOW IT WORKS ONLY WITH THE ADSENSE NEW CODE, the one with the ```<ins>``` html5 tag
  
  TIP: this script can be used also to passback to in-house Ads for who got adblock (need to customize behaivor)
